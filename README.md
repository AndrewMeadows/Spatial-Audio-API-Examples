# Spatial Audio API Examples
This repository contains example projects that make use of the [Spatial Audio API](https://highfidelity.com/api/).

These example projects augment the API walkthrough guides you can find at [highfidelity.com/api/guides](https://www.highfidelity.com/api/guides).

**We would love your contributions!** If you're interested in submitting an example application of your own, open a pull request against this repository.

# The `experiments` Directory
üêâ The `experiments` directory of this repository contains experimental example projects that import the High Fidelity Spatial Audio Client Library. These examples may not be documented as thoroughly as the above examples. Enjoy!

## Plain HTML/JS Experiments

# Live Demos
This repository employs GitHub Pages, which means that you can look at some of these example applications live by browsing [this page](https://highfidelity.github.io/Spatial-Audio-API-Examples/).

**None of the example projects committed to this repository contain an embedded JWT, which means connecting to the Spatial Audio API Server from these live examples *will not work*.**

For more information about JWTs, see the "Authorized Access and JWTs" section of our [Spatial Audio FAQ](https://www.highfidelity.com/api-spatial-audio-faq).
