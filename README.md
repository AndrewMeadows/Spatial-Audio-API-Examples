# High Fidelity Spatial Audio API Examples
This repository contains example projects that make use of the [High Fidelity Spatial Audio API](https://highfidelity.com/api/).

These example projects augment the API walkthrough guides you can find at [highfidelity.com/api/guides](https://www.highfidelity.com/api/guides).

# The `examples` Directory
üòé The `examples` directory of this repository contains complete, commented, tested, hopefully-working example projects that import the High Fidelity Spatial Audio Client Library.

# The `experiments` Directory
üêâ The `experiments` directory of this repository contains... **experimental example projects** that import the High Fidelity Spatial Audio Client Library. These examples might not work. If they do work, they'll almost certainly be really cool. They also might not be documented very thoroughly. Enjoy!
